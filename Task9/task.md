Task 9/40
In this exercise, you will create a Deployment and expose a container port for its Pods. You will demonstrate the differences between the service types ClusterIP and NodePort.

Note

If you do not already have a Kubernetes cluster, you can create a local Kubernetes cluster by following Day06 Video Also, do the node binding at the cluster level if you are using KIND. The Day9 video has the details on how to do that.

Task details
Create a Service named myapp of type ClusterIP that exposes port 80 and maps to the target port 80.

Create a Deployment named myapp that creates 1 replica running the image nginx:1.23.4-alpine. Expose the container port 80.

Scale the Deployment to 2 replicas.

Create a temporary Pod using the image busybox and run a wget command against the IP of the service.

Run a wget command against the service outside the cluster.

Change the service type so the Pods can be reached outside the cluster.

Run a wget command against the service outside the cluster.

Discuss: Can you expose the Pods as a service without a deployment?

Discuss: Under what condition would you use the service types LoadBalancer, node port, clusterIP, and external?
